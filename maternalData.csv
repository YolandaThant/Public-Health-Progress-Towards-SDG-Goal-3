,NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,- Data not available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,j Excludes Brazil and Mexico.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,R Data refer to the most recent year available during the period specified in the column heading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,x Data refer to years or periods other than those specified in the column heading. Such data are not included in the calculation of regional and global averages. Estimates from data years prior to 2000 are not displayed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"C Maternal mortality estimates are from the 2023 United Nations inter-agency maternal mortality estimates. Periodically, the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-agency Group (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the World Bank and the United Nations Population Division) produces internationally comparable sets of maternal mortality data that account for the well-documented problems of under-reporting and misclassification of maternal deaths, including also estimates for countries with no data. Please note that owing to an evolving methodology, these values are not comparable with previously reported maternal mortality ratio 'adjusted' values.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,DEFINITIONS OF THE INDICATORS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Life expectancy at birth – Number of years newborn female children would live if subject to the mortality risks prevailing for the cross–section of population at the time of their birth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Universal health coverage Service Coverage sub-index on reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health - Average coverage of essential services based on eight tracer indicators related to interventions across reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health areas. The index is calculated as a weighted average of the included indicators and is reported on a scale of 0 to 100.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods - Percentage of adolescent girls and women (aged 15–49) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Antenatal care (at least one visit) – Percentage of adolescent girls and women (aged 15–49) attended at least once during pregnancy by skilled health personnel (typically a doctor, nurse or midwife).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Antenatal care (at least four visits) – Percentage of adolescent girls and women (aged 15–49) attended by any provider at least four times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Skilled birth attendant – Percentage of births from adolescent girls and women (aged 15–49) attended by skilled heath personnel (typically a doctor, nurse or midwife).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Institutional delivery – Percentage of adolescent girls and women (aged 15–49) who gave birth in a health facility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,C-section – Percentage of births delivered by Caesarean section. NB: C-section rates between 10 per cent and 15 per cent are expected with adequate levels of emergency obstetric care.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Postnatal health check for newborn – Percentage of last live births in the last two years who received a health check within two days after delivery. NB: For MICS, health check refers to a health check while in facility or at home following delivery or a postnatal visit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Postnatal health check for mother – Percentage of adolescent girls and women (aged 15–49) who received a health check within 2 days after delivery of their most recent live birth in the last 2 years. NB: For MICS, health check refers to a health check while in facility or at home following delivery or a postnatal visit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Number of maternal deaths – Number of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes (modelled estimates).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Maternal mortality ratio – Number of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes per 100,000 live births during the same time period (modelled estimates).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Lifetime risk of maternal death – Lifetime risk of maternal death takes into account both the probability of becoming pregnant and the probability of dying as a result of that pregnancy, accumulated across a woman’s reproductive years (modelled estimates).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
